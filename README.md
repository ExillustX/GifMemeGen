*Since many of you kept asking me why did i shutdown the bot...*

To process GIFs i needed a server with good a CPU/MEMORY and it costed around $20 per month. I couldn't afford it anymore (plus Discord was already asking me to verify the bot) so i decided to shutdown it down, sorry.

With that being said, this project is open source and you can still host it on your own server/computer, though you will need some basic knowledge in NPM and Environment Variables (since this app uses `dotenv` to store senstiive data like tokens).

## Requirements:
- ImageMagick: https://imagemagick.org
